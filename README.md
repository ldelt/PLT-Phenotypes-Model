# Model Execution Instructions

## Running the Model

Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/ldelt/PLT-Phenotypes-Model/releases).

You can run the model in two ways:

1. **Using Jupyter Notebook**  
   Launch the model via the `run_model.ipynb` notebook using Google Colab.

2. **Using Python Script**  
   To install the necessary libraries, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.  
   Then, run the model directly from the command line using the `run_model.py` script.

## Modifying Input Parameters

Input parameters can be adjusted within either `run_model.ipynb` or `run_model.py`.  
Explanations are provided in the comments within these files.

## Changing Model Behavior

To modify the core logic of the program, edit the `models.py` file.
